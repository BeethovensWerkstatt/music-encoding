        <p>Many institutions and individuals assisted in the preparation of these Guidelines and in the overall development of the Music Encoding Initiative
            (MEI) schema.</p>
        <p>Grateful acknowledgment is given to the following institutions for their generous contributions: the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and
            the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) for their joint support of the MEI project, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the
            University of Virginia and the Hochschule für Musik in Detmold for graciously hosting grant-funded meetings, the Center for Computer-Assisted Research
            in the Humanities at Stanford University for permission to make use of their large collection of encoded music, the Akademie der Wissenschaften und
            der Literatur in Mainz for their recognition of the potential of MEI, and the Musikwissenschaftliches Seminar Detmold/Paderborn and the University of
            Virginia Library for providing financial support and environments that encourage experimentation.</p>

            Fotis Jannidis (Universität Würzburg); Axel Teich Geertinger (Royal Danish Library); and Frans Wiering (University of Utrecht) for providing expertise
            on a wide range of topics related to music notation modelling.</p>
        <p>Also thanks to Syd Bauman, Terry Catapano, and Sebastian Rahtz for their invaluable problem-solving assistance during the development of the RNG
            schema. Thanks to Sebastian Rahtz and James Cummings of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) for their help with making ODD work with MEI and their

        <p>Finally, the members of the Music Encoding Initiative would like to thank Perry Roland for his foresight, engagement and determination in laying the
            foundations of this initiative.</p>

        <head>MEI Design Principles</head>
        <p>This section of the tag library defines principles and criteria for designing, developing, and maintaining an XML-based encoding scheme for music
            notation documents.</p>
        <list>
            <head>Definitions and Parameters</head>
            <item>A music notation document is one that contains music notation; that is, any one of a number of "visual analogues of musical sound, either as a
                record of sound heard or imagined, or as a set of visual instructions for performers."<note target="n1"/></item>
            <item>The encoding scheme permits both the creation of new music notation documents and the conversion of existing ones from print and other
                electronic formats. However, conversion of existing documents may require revisions in content or rearrangement of information.</item>
        </list>
        <list>
            <head>General Principles</head>
            <item>No prima facia distinction is made between a primary source of music notation, such as an autograph or published score, and a secondary source,
                such as a scholarly edition based on one or more primary sources. The tag set encompasses both, and the encoder must choose the elements and
                attributes most appropriate in each case.</item>
            <item>As an encoded representation of one or more music notation documents, an MEI file may be employed as a surrogate for the original
                materials.</item>
            <item>Although the encoding scheme does not define or prescribe intellectual content for music notation documents, it does define content designation
                and is intended to be used with available data content standards. MEI identifies the essential data elements within music notation documents and
                establishes codes and conventions necessary for capturing and distinguishing information within those elements for future action or manipulation.
                While there are a few elements that ought to appear in any MEI document, various intellectual, technical, and economic factors influence the level
                of detail of analysis and encoding actually undertaken. Taking this into consideration, the encoding scheme is designed with a minimum of required
                elements and allows for progressively more detailed levels of description as desired.</item>
            <item>The encoding scheme preserves and enhances the current functionality of existing music notation documents. It permits identification of document
                structures and content that support description, navigation, analysis, and online and print presentation.</item>
            <item>The encoding scheme is intended to facilitate interchange between notational tools. It aims to assist in the creation of more effective and
                consistent encoding, encourage the creation of union databases of music notation documents, and permit the reuse of encoded data for multiple output
                purposes. It will also ensure that machine-readable music notation documents will outlive changing hardware and software environments because they
                are based on a platform-independent standard.</item>
        </list>
        <list>
            <head>Structural Features</head>
            <item>The encoding scheme is based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML), a text-based format for representing structured information. It is expressed
                as an One Document Does-it-all (ODD) document, referred to as the "Music Encoding (MEI) Guidelines". For more information on ODD, please refer to
                TEI Guidelines chapter 22(http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TD.html), chapter 23
                (http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/USE.html), and to the TEI's "Getting Started with P5 ODDs" document
                (http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/Customization/odds.xml).</item>
            <item>Related or complementary standards, such as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange, the
                Encoded Archival Description (EAD) DTD, MARC formats, existing notation encoding schemes, etc. have been consulted and employed as appropriate. The
                data model includes a header that is comparable to the TEI header, and TEI and EAD naming conventions and tag structures have been used whenever
                feasible. With respect to metadata, MEI recognizes the inter-relationship between the metadata content found in the MEI header and that of catalog
                records, authority records, and finding aids, and it provides for the use of an encoding equivalency attribute for MEI elements corresponding to
                fields in other metadata standards.</item>
            <!-- <item>The encoding standard consists of three parts: an RNG-compliant schema, a tag library containing definitions of the schema's elements and
                attributes as well as examples of tag use, and application guidelines.</item> -->
            <item>To ensure broad international and multi-repertoire application of MEI, existing musical terminology was used in building the data model where
                practical. In addition, a method for localization of the data model's names has been provided. Finally, extensive use of attributes in the schema
                permits the refinement of element meanings with specific geographic or temporal contexts.</item>
        </list>
        <list>
            <head>Control and Maintenance</head>
            <item>Control and maintenance of the schema and its documentation will be provided by a maintenance agency working in concert with the national and
                international music communities, assisted in an advisory capacity by other interested groups of users.</item>
